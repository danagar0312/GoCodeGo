2 Approach

BFS :

- declare queue. add root node to it.
- iterate while the queue is not empty
- iterate through the current size of the queue, poll the first element only which will be the leftmost element
- if the node left and right child is not null, add to the queue again.

DFS :

- maintain currentDepth variable - 0, which initially represent root node level.
- start with depth = 1
- create function which takes root node
- if the currentDepth is less than depth, which is like 1 > 0, then node will be added to the stack memory
then increase currentDepth by 1. This will be the left most node of the node(as we pass left and right to the memory)
- if the node left and right child is not null, pass them recurrsively to the function
